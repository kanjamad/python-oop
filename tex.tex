Now that we've seen a dog-based example 
of Python classes, 
let's make one a bit more sophisticated. 
Create a BankAccount class.

1. Bank accounts should be created with the 
accountType property (like "savings" or 
"checking").

2.Bank accounts should have a class-level 
variable tracking the total amount of 
money in all account objects.

3.Each account should keep track of its own 
current balance.

4.Each account should have a deposit 
and a withdraw method.

5.Each account should start with its 
balance set to zero.


Things to think about:

Any starting values for variables should be set in the __init__ method
Class variables are declared inside the class but outside any methods
Instance variables are declared inside the __init__ method
Does your __init__ method need to accept any parameters?
